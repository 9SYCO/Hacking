# What is Tor and how does it work?
Tor (formerly an acronym for “The Onion Router”) is often touted as a way to browse the web anonymously. From human rights activists evading oppressive governments to drug dealers selling through online marketplaces, Tor is a popular way to gain significantly more anonymity than you would normally have online. At the same time, Tor isn’t perfect, so it can provide a false sense of security if used incorrectly.

# What does Tor do?
Using the Tor Browser is similar to using any other web browser. Although the process of starting up the browser differs slightly from Chrome or Firefox (Tor must configure a connection to the Tor network before the browser can start), actually browsing the web with Tor is pretty intuitive.

The main difference is that when you browse the web with Tor, your real IP address and other system information is obscured from the websites and services you're visiting. Additionally, it also hides what you're doing from your Internet Service Provider.

The primary uses of Tor are the following:

Bypassing censorship and surveillance
Visiting websites anonymously
Accessing Tor hidden services (.onion sites)
